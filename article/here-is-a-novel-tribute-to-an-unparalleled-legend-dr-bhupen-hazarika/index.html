<p>8th September marks the 96th birth anniversary of Dr Bhupen Hazarika, popularly known as the Bard of Brahmaputra. And what better way to observe his birthday than a befitting tribute by way of a mesmerizing musical rendition</p>
<p>"Bimurto Mur Nixati Jen is an iconic song and I had longed to cover this song primarily with piano and contemporary dance. Well knowing the sheer magnitude of this song and how it resonates with the emotions of millions of Assamese people, I shall be honest that I had to tread carefully. I was very clear that this is a tribute as Dr Bhupen Hazarika is a legend who has inspired so many artists like me. Tributes are very difficult and I would like to state here again that this is a very humble endeavour. I reiterate that we have all tried very humbly to pay a tribute to our inspiration," Abhishruti Bezbaruah There are numerous ways to preserve the cultural identity of a state. A rendition of an iconic work of an iconic musician is definitely a cardinal way. In this context, the significance of the just released (on YouTube) music video 'Bimurto Mur Nixati Jen' cannot be overemphasized. This very lyrical and sensuous love song replete with some profound reflections was composed by none other than Dr Bhupen Hazarika, who needs no introduction in Assam. Needlees to say Bhupen Da's (as he was fondly addressed) eternal voice continues to captivate the hearts and minds of people across the globe. "Dr Bhupen Hazarika is an eternal source of inspiration for artists like us and we decided to pay a very humble tribute to our legend through a rendition of one of his iconic songs- Bimurto Mur Nixati Jen," says Abhishruti Bezbaruah. The 'we' referred by Abhishruti, who is an acclaimed singer of Assam includes Lima Das of 'Aamis' fame who is also a prolific Sattriya dancer and Promiti Phukan, a nuanced and versatile pianist who heads The Cadenza Music Academy. The video has been directed by the very erudite Samujjal Kashyap and supported by a dedicated and passionate team of musicians. The rendition indeed feels riveting. It scores high in terms of the blend of the aesthetic nuances of choreography and direction. The sheer dedication and passion of each of the three artists is almost palpable on screen. Abhishruti's melodious voice effortlessly and seamlessly balances the major and minor notes that are embedded in this six and half minute long song. Promiti's piano notes aptly support her voice and lend a faraway lilting feel of love and longing while Lima's dance steps accentuate every note. Although this is a contemporary rendition it is evident that there has been a conscious effort to retain the original essence of the composition. Along with the piano (as the main supporting background music) the saxophone too has been used in limited places and the combination of these two instruments has translated to a unique flavour and feel. Expressing her feelings for the song and why she had embarked on this collaborative work of art and music (for that is how it can also be interpreted by a section of people and connoisseurs of culture) Abhishruti says, "Bimurto Mur Nixati Jen is an iconic song and I had longed to cover this song primarily with piano and contemporary dance. Well knowing the sheer magnitude of this song and how it resonates with the emotions of millions of Assamese people, I shall be honest that I had to tread carefully. I was very clear that this is a tribute as Dr Bhupen Hazarika is a legend who has inspired so many artists like me. Tributes are very difficult and I would like to state here again that this is a very humble endeavour. I reiterate that we have all tried very humbly to pay a tribute to our inspiration." Talking about her experiences while creating this beautiful piece of work, Abhishruti says, "While I have taken a little artistic liberty in my rendition towards the end of the song my singular focus and conscious attempt has been to adhere to all the myriad graduations and variations (through voice modulation) of the original track." Incidentally, according to Abhishruti this rendition was inspired by two things- one her reverence and awe for Dr Bhupen Hazarika and two by an unforgettable stage performance (at Rabindra Bhavan) of Menaka PP Bora a renowned Sattriya dancer of our state. In her words, "Menaka PP Bora had danced to this very song ever so gracefully. Besides 'Bimurto Mur Nixati Jen' has always been one of my personal favourites from our legend and somewhere subconsciously many years ago I had resolved that one day I shall try to create a rendition." Abhishruti goes on to state that she was attracted to this composition from a very young age. "Being an Indian classical vocalist, the major- minor notes combinations really moved me. I was very fortunate to meet Dr. Bhupen Hazarika in his residence as a young 12 year old where I had the chance to sing this very song in front of him. For me it was a very significant evening of my life and I feel blessed," she shares. Abhishruti shares that she has been learning and listening to this song for years. She elaborates, "I have even been singing this song in jalsas and somewhere I longed to re-imagine this song with piano, vocals and dance. I had spoken to Promiti a few years back about doing this and unfortunately the ill-fated pandemic had set in then. However, this idea remained in my subconscious. Finally this year in May, Promiti and I started working on this song step by step. Personally I always wanted to work with Lima Das. I felt that her grace, her command over Sattriya dance and most importantly her artistic sensibility would be a wonderful addition to the song and lend a fillip to our overall creative endeavour. I am very grateful to Promiti Phukan and Lima Das for agreeing to collaborate with me and taking this forward. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my entire supporting team. The audio team comprised of Siddharth Barooa and Amitabh Barooa (in music arrangement) and Gorisha Nath (on backing vocals)." Incidentally, Abhishruti is acknowledged for her versatility in different genres of music. At the age of 19, she was the first Assamese woman to have won the All India Radio Hindustani Classical Music competition at the national level. "I started learning music from the age of six. I come from a family where culture, music and literature are very deeply ingrained so I had a supportive environment for my craft. My journey as a singer /artist has been no different from other artistes. Inorder to cultivate my craft and evolve with it I had to discipline myself a lot," she shares. So what does music mean to Abhishruti? "Purely stated music amounts to worship for me. It is transcendental and aids my comprehension of spirituality. Whenever I feel stressed I resort to music and it is my elixir and succour," she replies. Given her unflinching dedication and commitment, one naturally senses that Abhishruti has her own vision in relation to the future of Indian classical music. "Well I love folk music equally and my performances include a number of folk songs too. And going forward I would want to strive hard in terms of promoting and popularizing both these genres in our state and country. Here I must mention that overall in our state discourses on Indian Classical music are lacking. I want to address this aspect and contribute my bit in terms of initiating a climate of informed exchanges. I also want to concentrate on building a database of folk music in our state. And yes I definitely want to travel to familiarise myself with the music of different places (through research and study) and consolidate my learnings into various facets of my life and work," she states. Bimurto Mur Nixati Jen is a very dialogue driven song. "And hence it was a privilege for me to dance to this song as dance as a craft is an amalgamation of facial expressions, emotions, gestures and body movements," says Lima Das. She goes on to add that she experienced an inexplicable pull with the lyrics of the song and that the experience has helped her to evolve further in her craft. In Lima's words, "As artists we believe that all artistic ventures and endeavours are destined and aided by the high power. Even the timings of events and various facets connected to the creation/production are destined. And we actually experienced this beautiful serendipity. For instance my shoot happened on the banks of the Brahmaputra on 11th August which was a full moon night. Now it had rained on the days right before this date. However, our special and chosen day was rain free. Strangely and rather uncannily the rhythm of the wind too synchronized with our needs- meaning it was in tune with the choreography." For Promiti Phukan the experience has been equally satisfying and enriching. "I am essentially a pianist who specialises in Western classical music and therefore initially I was just a little apprehensive as to whether I would be able to do justice to a traditional Assamese song, that too a song by the Bard of Brahmaputra himself. To put it simply I had to re-imagine my piano notes. However once I embarked upon and immersed myself in this project I realised that by the grace of the higher power, through a little improvisation my notes were able to complement the song. And actually I am not very surprised as music after all is a universal language," says Promiti and adds, "There was an unspoken but very strong understanding between all the artists involved in this project. Everyone was invested in the final goal of creating a rendition that would strike indelible chords with the audience. Also every single artist was utterly supportive of the others. Infact even the technicians/experts at the recording studio have enriched the final outcome with their nuanced suggestions." The experiences have definitely manifested in the final creation for the rendition is a subtle, understated and mesmerizing piece of work. It is a sheer labour of love and dedication and shall remain a timeless and meaningful rendition of one of Dr Bhupen Hazarika's very popular and iconic songs- Bimurto Mur Nixati Jen. The video has already received heartening and very positive responses. An expected response as after all it is one of the most iconic songs of an artist who is simply unparalleled till date.Also Read: Salman Rushdie and Fatwa on Freedom of SpeechAlso Watch: </p>
