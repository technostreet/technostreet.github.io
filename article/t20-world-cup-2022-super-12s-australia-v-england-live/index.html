<p>Updates from the crunch Group 1 match at the MCGStart time at the cricket in Melbourne is 7pm AEDT/9am BSTAny thoughts? Email Jonathan or tweet @JPHowcroftMelbourne, like all of Australia’s east coast, has been saturated this spring, and today has been no exception. What has made today exceptional is quite how spitefully the rain has been delivered, blowing in horizontally in unpredictable gusts, at a frigid temperature. The ‘feels like’ widget of the forecast dashboard hasn’t reached double figures all day. It is grim.Ireland vs Afghanistan has already been washed out without a ball being bowled. The MCG is grey and sodden. We are very unlikely to start on time. Continue reading...</p>
<p>Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature Live feed Key events 46m ago Weather 1h ago Preamble Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature 3m ago 08.54 BST “We don’t want to lose any games but it is probably going to galvanise the group in terms of our approach,” explained England coach Matthew Mott following his side’s defeat to Ireland. “We need to show a response. We need to come out with a really attacking mindset and maybe throw caution to the wind and see how we go.” I like England’s bullishness in white ball cricket. I just wonder if this particular group has the confidence of recent iterations to back it up, especially without Eoin Morgan calling the shots. They could definitely do with Jos Buttler and Alex Hales both going full Finn Allen off the top, especially if it’s a five-over slog. Matthew Mott wants England to have attacking mindset against Australia Read more 4m ago 08.53 BST Matt Hobbs has emailed a terrific question: ”Such a shame about the weather but a genuine question: would England prefer one point or the lottery of a five-over game? Their net run rate is currently better than Australia’s although the Aussies have two easier (at least on paper) fixtures to come. I’m not sure England would hate a draw and living to fight another day.” I don’t think anybody ever wants a washout, do they? But I reckon England would be the happier of the two teams if the points are shared because Australia are the side that needs to make up ground. England lead Australia on net run rate 0.239 to -1.555, so a point apiece keeps their noses in front. But like you say, England’s remaining fixtures – New Zealand and Sri Lanka – are tougher on paper than Australia’s – Ireland and Afghanistan – so this could be a chance of making a decisive move up the table. 13m ago 08.45 BST Here in Australia, Channel Nine’s live coverage has been very clunky, and they’ve just filled some time celebrating Matthew Wade’s courage for preparing to play tonight despite being diagnosed with Covid yesterday. Including making a joke about England’s players staying one and a half metres away from him. Instead of, you know, asking why on earth in the middle of a pandemic and on the cusp of a new wave in Australia everybody isn’t taking the kind of precautions we took for granted up until a few months ago. Under tournament rules Wade is allowed to play (if he feels up to it) but he has to make his own way to the ground and change in separate facilities. Teammate Adam Zampa also tested positive ahead of the Afghanistan match, but swapping him out for Ashton Agar was straightforward. Wade is trickier because Australia do not have another wicketkeeper in their squad. Josh Inglis was originally named but after he got injured he was replaced by Cameron Green, not another gloveman. Recently diagnosed with Covid, Matthew Wade and Adam Zampa survey the MCG. Photograph: Quinn Rooney/Getty Images 20m ago 08.37 BST Cut off time is 9:46pm in Melbourne. Probably a coin toss whether we get a five over game (which itself is, well, a coin toss). #T20WorldCup — Ben Jones (@benjonescricket) October 28, 2022 21m ago 08.36 BST “Kia ora Jonathan, from Rotorua in Aotearoa/New Zealand,” good evening Graeme Simpson. “Last time in Melbourne in 2011, same time of year, and it went from a muggy 30C to torrential rain and 15C in 1/2 an hour. That was not that unusual. Current sh*te weather is very much a product of climate change. ’Straya is a barometer - either on fire or under water. ngā mihi.” Meanwhile, at the front of the paper… World close to ‘irreversible’ climate breakdown, warn major studies Read more And not unrelated: Australian sport stars call for more action to combat climate ‘havoc’ Read more Updated at 08.38 BST 26m ago 08.32 BST George clearly didn’t read my earlier post. Inspection at 7.30pm, an hour from now. It's still raining so there is a chance it will be called off then. — George Dobell (@GeorgeDobell1) October 28, 2022 27m ago 08.31 BST Englishman Simon Burnton spoke to Australian Mike Hussey about being an Australian in the England camp when England take on Australia in Australia, and the possibility of remaining involved with England when Australia visit England next year for an Ashes tour. “It seems to be a big issue for everyone on the outside,” he says. “For me, there’s a much bigger picture than just that rivalry. I think it’s a great opportunity to be involved with a new environment, a new team, a new country, to see how they go about it.” ‘A bigger picture than rivalry’: Michael Hussey focuses on England role Read more 34m ago 08.23 BST Geoff Lemon sets the scene for a match that may never take place, cautioning that “Australia and England in their current state is not exactly a battle of the titans, but a struggle between teams looking to emerge from difficulty.” Australia and England meet on T20 World Cup precipice having both lost their bite | Geoff Lemon Read more 43m ago 08.15 BST I know it’s unfair to blame the messenger, but boooooooooo George, booooooooooo. Told from those who have been out on the pitch that it's saturated. So even if the rain stopped now (and the forecast does improve a little as the evening wears on) it's not looking great, I'm afraid. — George Dobell (@GeorgeDobell1) October 28, 2022 46m ago 08.11 BST Weather Melbourne, like all of Australia’s east coast, has been saturated this spring, and today has been no exception. What has made today exceptional is quite how spitefully the rain has been delivered, blowing in horizontally in unpredictable gusts, at a frigid temperature. The ‘feels like’ widget of the forecast dashboard hasn’t reached double figures all day. It is grim. Ireland vs Afghanistan has already been washed out without a ball being bowled. The MCG is grey and sodden. We are very unlikely to start on time. More promisingly, the raincloud the size of Wales that has sat over the state of Victoria for most of the day is moving its way eastwards, and should soon clear Melbourne CBD, aside for some tendril-like showers. These modern grounds drain quickly and umpires have already shown their eagerness to play through tricky conditions this tournament, so we may yet have a match, however short. For that to occur play needs to be underway by 10.04pm (12.04pm BST). A disappointed Barry McCarthy rues Ireland’s inability to take on Afghanistan at a rain-soaked MCG. Photograph: Martin Keep/AFP/Getty Images 1h ago 08.00 BST Preamble Jonathan Howcroft Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of the 2022 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup . Weather permitting, Australia vs England in Group 1 of the Super 12s begins at the Melbourne Cricket Ground at 7pm local time (9am BST). If the rain does hold off, this is a fixture of enormous consequence to the tournament. After Australia were bullied by New Zealand and England outplayed by Ireland , defeat tonight probably spells the end of the loser’s campaign. Australia rebounded with a Marcus Stoinis-inspired settler against Sri Lanka, but the defending champions haven’t clicked yet, extending a prolonged run of indifferent performances in the format. Of greatest concern is the output of skipper Aaron Finch at the top of the order. Finch has already announced his retirement from the ODI format and is limping towards the end of his T20i career on home soil. England are back in action just two days after they failed to adapt to the characterful MCG surface against Ireland. The seam bowlers were too short and the batters never looked assured on a deck that offered plenty of movement and bounce. Against the highest quality pace attack in world cricket England’s top order need to find both intent and timing. I’ll be back shortly with the toss and the teams synonyms for rain. In the meantime, you can contribute by sending me an email or directing any tweets to @JPHowcroft . A sodden MCG is wet, muddy, and miserable ahead of Australia and England’s clash.
