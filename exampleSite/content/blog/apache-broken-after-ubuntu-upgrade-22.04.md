# After ubuntu upgrade to 22.04 apache2 was broken

### Error - apache2.service: Control process exited, code=exited, status=139/n/a

## Solution - 

### $ cd /etc/apache2/  
  
### $ l mods-*/php*

#### The "status=139" error must have something to do with having multiple, conflicting versions of PHP enabled.

  
In my case, it was showing php7.4 and php8.1 both.

### $ sudo a2dismod php7.4

### $ systemctl restart apache2
