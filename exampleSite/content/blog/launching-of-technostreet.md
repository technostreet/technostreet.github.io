# Launching of TechnoStreet

I was thinking about, I should have a platform where I can update/share my technical expertise with worldwide users. On the other side I was not willing to spend any money for blogging platform. Earlier I had hear about the github pages.  
I was agree to go with github pages.   
The next challenge was, while using the github pages, you can only launch the static html +CSS+Jquery based websites.  
After some research, I found [forestry](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry") that was very helpful in managing the static website and generating the pages or blogs.
