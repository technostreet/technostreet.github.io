<p>IND vs BAN Live Score 2nd Test Day 2: India 86/3 at Lunch; Bangladesh picked three wickets in 1st session</p>
<p>11:09 (IST)LUNCH!India 86/3.Excellent morning session for Bangladesh and Taijul Islam. The spinner has got all three wickets and Bangladesh have restricted India from scoring freely. India still trail by 141 runs. For India, the disappointing part is that the top three batters have not made it big despite getting starts.11:05 (IST)After 36 overs,India 86/3 ( Virat Kohli 18 , Rishabh Pant (W) 12)IND vs BAN LiveIndia go in Lunch after losing three wickets. It could have been five. Two chances came in last over before lunch. Mehidy got Pant to edge one to slip but Litton Das dropped it. There was also a run-out chance but Kohli was quick to return to the keeper's end after being sent back by non-striker Pant. Kohli was not happy with Pant's initial call for a quick single. 11:00 (IST)IND vs BAN Live Cricket ScoreDROPPED! Pant goes for a hard slash off Mehidy. It was a short ball but Pant edged it to the slip fielder who squandered it. 10:55 (IST)After 34 overs,India 82/3 ( Virat Kohli 17 , Rishabh Pant (W) 9)India vs Bangladesh LIVE ScorePant gets a boundary to ease some pressure. Short ball from Mehidy and Pant blasts it to the mid-wicket. India need to keep scoring regularly, otherwise pressure will rise. 10:49 (IST)After 32 overs,India 76/3 ( Virat Kohli 17 , Rishabh Pant (W) 3)IND vs BAN Live ScoreChance! Kohli edged the delivery from Mehidy but it hit the keeper's pads and evaded the slip fielder. The ball stayed low and Kohli expected it to turn but it didn't and that outfoxed the batter. 10:46 (IST)After 31 overs,India 73/3 ( Virat Kohli 16 , Rishabh Pant (W) 1)India vs Bangladesh LIVE ScoreTaijul Islam is proving to be Bangladesh's trump card here. He was very good on the first Test as well. Pujara is the latest to fall. He went soft on the fuller ball but nudged it to the short leg who took an excellent catch. Rishabh Pant has joined Kohli in the middle now.10:40 (IST)India vs Bangladesh LIVEOUT! Pujara c Mominul b Taijul Islam 24(55) Mominul takes a good catch at short leg and Pujara has to go. Excellent catching this. Pujara pushed the fuller ball to close-in fielder and Mominul pounced on that. Pujara didn't believe his luck. It got checked and third umpire gave it out. 10:34 (IST)After 29 overs,India 70/2 ( Cheteshwar Pujara 24 , Virat Kohli 14)IND vs BAN Live ScoreAnother maiden over for Taijul. Pujara was on strike. Anjum Chopra on air is wondering why Shakib is not bowling more but it could be because Taijul offers the same. And with Mehidy they have extra variety. Bangladesh are hoping to use the rough areas. 10:25 (IST)After 26 overs,India 68/2 ( Cheteshwar Pujara 22 , Virat Kohli 14)IND vs BAN LiveSix wickets for India were taken by the pacers but Bangladesh wants their spinners to do the job for them, A quiet over form Mehidy. Only two coming from it. 10:19 (IST)After 25 overs,India 66/2 ( Cheteshwar Pujara 21 , Virat Kohli 13)India vs Bangladesh LIVE Cricket ScoreTrial by spin here for India. Taskin is out and Mehidy Hasan the off-spinner is bowling along with Taijul. Indian batters are taking a cautious approach right now. India trail by 161 runs now.10:15 (IST)What a guy!𝐇𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝟖𝐭𝐡 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐧 𝐛𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝟕𝟎𝟎𝟎 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐫𝐮𝐧𝐬.#TeamIndia https://t.co/XsSeRJZIlD— BCCI (@BCCI) December 23, 202210:12 (IST)IND vs BAN Live ScoreCheteshwar Pujara has crossed the 7000-run mark in Test cricket.

At this end, Shakib tried one over, replacing Khaled but has now called Taskin to bowl. Five from the over including a glorious cover drive four for Kohli.09:59 (IST)IND vs BAN Live Cricket ScoreWhat a shot from Kohli! Taskin Ahmed who has just come into the attack gets the treatment with a fabulous cover drive. IND 60/209:49 (IST)After 18 overs,India 48/2 ( Cheteshwar Pujara 12 , Virat Kohli 4)India vs Bangladesh LIVESingle on the first ball by Pujara with a cut shot to the sweeper cover. Kohli plays out the rest of the over. One from Taijul's over. 09:48 (IST)After 17 overs,India 47/2 ( Cheteshwar Pujara 11 , Virat Kohli 4)Kohli gets off the mark. Streaky boundary. It was in the air but away from the gully fielder as Kohli went for a cut shot off Khaled Ahmed. 09:41 (IST)IND vs BAN Live ScoreAfter 16 overs,India 38/2 ( Cheteshwar Pujara 6 , Virat Kohli 0)Virat Kohli has come in to bat. India still trail by 189 runs and it's time for Kohli and Pujara to stitch a big partnership. Excellent wicket-maiden over for Taijul. Bangladesh have the perfect start and will be eyeing more wickets. 09:38 (IST)OUT! Shubman Gill lbw b Taijul Islam 20(39)Another wicket for Taijul. Gill got onto his knees for a sweep shot but failed to make connection and it's a simple decision for the umpire. Kohli joins Pujara in the middle.09:36 (IST)IND vs BAN LiveAfter 15 overs,India 38/1 ( Shubman Gill 20 , Cheteshwar Pujara 6)Seven runs from Khaled's over. The pacer has been good from the other end, creating chances. Gill got a triple and two more runs in the over but Khaled comes back by beating Pujara at the outside edge. It's a very good pitch for bowling with lateral movement. 09:29 (IST)Cheteshwar Pujara is the new man in and he gets a boundary with an outside edge beating the first slip.Taijul is having a good time here.09:25 (IST)IND vs BAN Live ScoreOUT! Rahul lbw b Taijul Islam 10(45)Rahul wanted to come down and take the attack to the spinner but the ball kept low and didn't turn enough as the batter got trapped in front of the stumps. Initially it was given out but good review by the hosts.09:23 (IST)India vs Bangladesh LIVE ScoreDRS taken against Rahul. He was coming down vs Taijul and got hit on pads. And he's OUT!IND 27/109:19 (IST)India vs Bangladesh LIVEThe ball is only 11 overs old but Bangladesh have left-arm spinner Taijul operating from one end. The idea is to make use of the rough areas near the off-stump of right-handers, but Rahul did well in the last over to get a boundary with excellent footwork. IND 26/009:15 (IST)Rahul gets the first boundary of the match. Creates room by going on the backfoot and drives the back of length ball through cover. Brilliant shot. 09:11 (IST)IND vs BAN Live Cricket ScoreIND 21/0 (10)Taijul Islam bowls from the other end and starts with a maiden. There's no hurry right now for Indian batters. Important they play out the tricky morning session carefully and then cash in on the opportunity. 09:05 (IST)India vs Bangladesh LIVE Cricket ScoreIND 21/0 (9)Brilliant first ball by Khaled. Nipped back in, cutting Gill into half and flew over the stumps. A single for Gill with a push to midwicket. One more for Rahul at the square leg area. 09:00 (IST)India vs Bangladesh LIVEIndian openers KL Rahul and Shubman Gill are out in the middle. Khaled Ahmed will bowl the first over of the day.08:47 (IST)IND vs BAN Live ScorePitch report: "Already a lot of wear and tear. You can see three roughs that are pretty close to the off-stump of a right-hander. One of them is in the danger area. That means there's a new dynamic coming into play. These roughs are going to be great allies for the spinners," says Sanjay Manjrekar.08:36 (IST)India vs Bangladesh LIVE Cricket ScoreDay 2 is of massive importance.Given that hosts were bowled out for 227 on the first day itself, the Day 2 could become the most crucial of all in the second Test.

It was important to keep bowling in the right areas and tried to do the same. Dry grass is there and it's a bit spongy. We were trying to reverse the ball and bowl wicket-to-wicket, we got wickets because of that."08:04 (IST)Unadkat is back playing Test cricket for India after a gap of 12 years and 2 days which is the longest interval between Test appearances for any player in the 21st century. Here he speaks about his comeback: From visualizing his maiden Test wicket, displaying patience and commitment to talking about his famous Tweet 👌🏻👌🏻In conversation with comeback man @JUnadkat 🙌🏻 - By @RajalArora Full interview 🎥🔽https://t.co/k7ihfe8R0u pic.twitter.com/0JsXUJIffe— BCCI (@BCCI) December 22, 202208:01 (IST)Exactly what happened on Day 1?Umesh Yadav had four wickets, Jaydev Unadkat on return took two and the rest went to R Ashwin as Bangladesh were bowled out of 227 after batting first.
