<p>Given people of this age going through a full-blown pandemic and there are indications and rumors of apocalypse around, who isn’t interested in a series similar to that? Well, The Stand fulfills all of the expectations of the users from a post-apocalyptic genre. This show, which is based on the United series is a nine episodes series. It is inspired by a quite old but famous as well as classic titled “The Stand” authored by Stephen King. This novel, which was authored by Stephen King, an American author revolves around the plot of the pandemic-struck era.  This book was released in 1978 and has been a part of various adaptions, with The Stand television miniseries being the latest one. This book subsequently the show also focuses on the post-pandemic effects, what one goes through physically and mentally along with the battle between good and evil as usual playing a crucial role. It shows how the survivors who escaped the brutal pandemic deal with life, their perception of it, and the changes they implemented. One of the great things about this novel is its picturization of characters which was subsequently transferred in the present show, the portrayal of the modern era.    This series was foremostly broadcasted on 17th December 2020 approximately two years ago. Even though the book garnered positive reviews prominently, this show was a target for mixed reviews. While few loved the depiction, there was a circulation of reviews it could have been way better. Also, in season 1, the viewers who have previously read the book can see the ending is different to raise curiosity, rather than being predictive, season1’s plot even though its drawbacks has ignited a fire of curiosity among viewers, who cannot wait for the upcoming seasons.  The way Stephen King authors a book, which is jumping off in between events, has given a good twist to the show as well. This show which was created by Josh Boone and Benjamin Cavell has garnered 56% percent on Rotten Tomatoes. This show would be nice for the ones who enjoy the genre based on disasters, horror, post-apocalyptic fantasy, and drama. Go, tune in to the series soon! The Stand Season 2 Release Date Now, coming onto the season 2 release date of The Stand, fans are eagerly waiting for it as it is not entirely based on the original novel. As we all are aware the novel does not have a sequel, many expected it to be finished in merely one season. But the plotlines, story, and end give viewers hope of it returning or some spin-off. Only time will tell.  The latest update from the network is it has not been renewed yet, but in case it does we should not expect a season for a couple of years. This series is assumed to be a limited one, with just one season, so enjoy this hour-long episode series. Do not think that, it is just a single season it would be boring! Well, do not worry, it is quite entertaining.  There are also whispers, that they are waiting for the second installment of the novel.
